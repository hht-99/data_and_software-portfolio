# Project Euler Problems
(https://projecteuler.net/)

In this folder are my attempts at some of the problems hosted by Project Euler
They highlight my abilities to apply logic and problem solving within a python coding environment.

Problems:
  -Even number check
  -Largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers
  -Prime number and non-prime factors check
  -Smallest number evenly divisible by numbers 1-20
  -Sum of all even terms in a Fibonacci seq. up to 4 mil
  -Sum of all multiples of 5 and 3 under 1000
