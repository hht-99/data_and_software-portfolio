# Project 04 - Series of Mini-Projects Showcasing The Use of Python, SQL and Power BI

---
## Project Goals

In this project series of projects I will explore the use of python, SQL and Power BI in relation to data handling, processing and presentation.
The learnings from these projects will then inform the pursuit of another 'Master' project in which all the skills developed will be put to use in a real-world setting.
