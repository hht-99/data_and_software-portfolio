# Harry Tran - Portfolio of Data and Software Projects

Hi!

My goal with this portfolio is to showcase my practical, industry-ready tech skills with a range of analytical data science and software development orientated projects. 

Found here are a collection of examples of some real-world problem solving built while transitioning from a medicinal chemistry PhD into data and software engineering roles.
